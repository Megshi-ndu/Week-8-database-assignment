# Week-8-database-assignment
Building a Complete Database Management System:
Hello there!
In week 8, we are designing and implementing a fully featured relational database on MySql.


Instructions:

1. Choose a real-world use case (e.g., Library Management, Student Records, Clinic Booking System, Inventory Tracking, E-commerce Store, etc.).

In our case we are creating a School database!
😁

2. Create a relational database schema that includes:

a) Well-structured tables.

b) Proper constraints (PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, NOT NULL, UNIQUE).

c) Relationships (One-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-Many, where applicable).

Use SQL to implement your design. 

Deliverables:😊

A single .sql file containing:

CREATE DATABASE statement
CREATE TABLE statements
Relationship constraints
